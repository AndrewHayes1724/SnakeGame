# Overview

This program was meant for me to learn a bit about Java in its basics and learn the fundamentals in syntax and object oriented programming.

This program is essentially the snake game but written in Java. It's a simple version but still the classic snake that everyone knows.

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

My purpose for writing this software was to understand the way Java works, how it differs from other object oriented languages like Python or C++ which I have a more extensive background in. So really just so that if I ever needed to use Java for something I do have an understanding of the language and its fundamentals.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code

The language I used was of course Java, within VSC I used the Java essentials extension which contains the awt library so that we could draw the game in an interface as well as take user inputs.

# Future Work

Here are a list of things/bugs I need to fix and/add in the future for fun and to learn more about Java
* The current config requires the compiler to be called via terminal, rather than through the run function of the IDE.
* Currently the snake isn't moving properly, a logic issue as opposed to a java issue.
* a proper menu system with memory of highscores and a leaderboard.
